## What Data We Collect

**We do not collect or transmit any personal data.**  
All extension logic runs entirely within your browser, and no data is sent to any external server.

Specifically:
- We do **not** collect your TikTok credentials.
- We do **not** access your TikTok content beyond what is necessary to automate the repost removal.
- We do **not** track your activity or browsing behavior.

## How the Extension Works

The extension performs the following actions:

- Opens [tiktok.com](https://www.tiktok.com) in a new browser tab.
- Navigates to your TikTok profile.
- Accesses the “Reposts” tab.
- Opens each reposted video and simulates a click to remove the repost.
- Repeats the process until all reposted videos are removed.

All actions are executed **locally in your browser** and require no server communication.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking scripts, or external APIs.

## Permissions Explanation

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

- **`tabs`**: Allows the extension to open TikTok in a new tab and interact with it.
- **`scripting`**: Required to execute the removal logic on the TikTok page.
- **`host_permissions`** (`https://www.tiktok.com/*`): Grants access exclusively to TikTok pages for automation. No other sites are accessed.

These permissions are strictly necessary for the extension to perform its intended function.
